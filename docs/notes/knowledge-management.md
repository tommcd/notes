# Knowledge Management

This note explains the knowledge management approach used in this system.

## Overview

This knowledge base uses a [[sample-note]] structure with:

- Markdown-first content
- Git-backed version control
- Automated reference management
- Cross-linking between notes

## Key Principles

1. **Atomic notes** - Each note covers one concept
2. **Linking** - Notes connect via wikilinks like [[sample-note]]
3. **Tagging** - Organize with consistent tags
4. **Citations** - Reference external sources

## Workflow

1. Create notes with proper front matter
2. Link related concepts
3. Tag for discoverability
4. Cite sources when needed

This creates a web of interconnected knowledge.
