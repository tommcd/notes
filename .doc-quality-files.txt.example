# Documentation Quality: Important Files
#
# This file configures which files should be linked (not just mentioned)
# in documentation. When these files are mentioned in markdown docs, they
# should be proper markdown links for refactoring safety.
#
# Format: One filename per line, lines starting with # are comments
#
# Why link files in documentation?
# 1. Refactoring safety: lychee catches broken links when files are renamed
# 2. Clickable navigation: Links work in GitHub, IDEs, and rendered docs
# 3. Automatic validation: lychee checks link validity
#
# Example:
#   Bad:  "See pyproject.toml for configuration"
#   Good: "See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) for configuration"
#
# To customize: Copy this file to .doc-quality-files.txt and edit the list.
# If .doc-quality-files.txt doesn't exist, sensible defaults are used.
